<h2>Hey <%= @user.name %></h2>
<p>
  The <b><%= @garbage_bag.name %></b> waste is full. As you are assigned as
  the responsible for this waste, could you please empty it and update this
  in the <a href="https://tomgijselinck.com/dorm-manager">dorm manager app</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In case you are not able to empty this garbage bag, you can notify this in
  the app garbage monitor (click <i>Can't empty trash</i>). A new responsible
  will be assigned.
