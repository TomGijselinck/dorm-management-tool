Hey <%= @user.name %>
===============================================

The <%= @garbage_bag.name %> waste is full. As you are assigned as the responsible
for this waste, could you please empty it and update this in
the dorm manager app (https://tomgijselinck.com/dorm-manager).

In case you are not able to empty this garbage bag, you can
notify this in the app garbage monitor (click Can't empty trash).
A new responsible will be assigned.
